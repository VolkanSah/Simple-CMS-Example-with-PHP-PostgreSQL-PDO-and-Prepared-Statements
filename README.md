# Simple CMS Example with PHP, PostgreSQL, PDO, and Prepared Statements

> [!CAUTION]
> This is a basic example demonstrating how to implement a simple CMS using PHP, PostgreSQL, PDO, and Prepared Statements. This is **not** a production-ready CMS.

### **Purpose:**

This repository is intended to provide a starting point for learning about:

* Connecting to a PostgreSQL database using PDO
* Using Prepared Statements for secure data interaction
* Implementing basic CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for pages

### **Important Notes:**

* **Security:** This example is **not** secure enough for production use. For a real-world CMS, you'll need to implement:
    * Robust user authentication and authorization
    * Input validation and sanitization
    * Cross-site scripting (XSS) protection
    * SQL injection prevention
    * Secure password storage
* **Functionality:** This example only provides basic page management. To build a full-fledged CMS, you'll need to add features such as:
    * Content management (posts, articles, etc.)
    * User roles and permissions
    * Templating and theming
    * Search functionality
    * Media management
    * And much more...

**Getting Started:**

1. **Set up a PostgreSQL database:**
   * Create a new database and user for this project.
   * Make sure you have the necessary database credentials in the `database.php` file.
2. **Create the database tables:**
   * You'll need at least a `pages` table with columns for `title` and `content`.
3. **Run the example code:**
   * You can use a local server or a web hosting service to run the code.
   * Access the example pages through your web browser.

**Disclaimer:**

This example is provided as-is and without warranty. It is intended for educational purposes only and should not be used in production environments without significant security enhancements and feature additions.
